Designed and developed a stock transaction system enabling users to create personal account and stock symbols, buy and sell orders, monitor order status etc. in C++

Applied socket programming to transmit XML requests/responses between client and server side in real-time

Implemented database schema in PostgreSQL to persist, manage and process accountâ€™s balance, shares and orders

Implemented priority queue data structure to manage client and server communication in multiple threads to handle high-concurrency requests and reduced the message delay time by 90%

Generated test cases on multi-threading modules and achieved more than 110 QPS per core based on the scalability validation

Developed a full-stack web application modeling UPS system paired with amazon ordering and delivery system in Django. Simulated the whole process from buying products to getting the package delivered.

Stored data in PostgreSQL and used Django ORM to interact with it.

Used Google Protocol Buffer to communicate with world-simulator and mini amazon system partner.

Designed UI with CSS, HTML and Bootstrap, realized featured web pages with search bar and user login/logout.
